# autoPayment
This script executes unclaimed rewards for both Kusama and Polkadot networks.

Users can set the relevant parameters in the description file, and if there is unclaim reward in a given era - it'll be executed.

To automate this script, we suggest using crontab.

Some of the ideas for this auto payment script were taken from Crunch auto payment app (https://github.com/turboflakes/crunch) which we obviously recommend to use as well.
